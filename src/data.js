Most of the layout was made with Flexbox with the exception of the mosaic layouts which were implemented with CSS grid. There's also a bit of JavaScript for the hamburger menu to toggle a class that opens the menu, and also an Intersection Observer which removes the class on scrolling. A couple of fun little CSS animations for links hover states and also for the hamburger menu opening.",
